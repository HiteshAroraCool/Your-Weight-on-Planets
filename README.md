# Weight Calculator for Planets

This is a simple weight calculator that determines your weight on different planets based on your input weight. It uses gravitational values to calculate the weight.

## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript**: Used for the weight calculation logic and interaction with the HTML elements.
- **Vanilla.js**: Utilized for smooth scrolling animations and handling intersections.
  - **IntersectionObserver**: Enables smooth animations when elements are scrolled into view.
  - **Event Listeners**: Attached to the weight input and planet selection for real-time updates and calculations.

- **HTML**: Provides the structure for user interaction.
  - `<select>`: Provides a dropdown list for planet selection.
  - `<input>`: Accepts user input for weight.
  - `<button>`: Triggers the weight calculation.
  - `<p>`: Displays the output of the weight calculation.
- **CSS**: Used for styling the web page elements, including transitions and animations for a smoother user experience.
  - **Motion**: Utilized for smooth transitions and animations to enhance the user experience.
  - **Blur**: Applied to elements for a blurred effect using the `filter` property.

## How it Works

1. **Input**: Enter your weight in the provided input field.
2. **Planet Selection**: Choose a planet from the dropdown list.
3. **Calculate**: Click the 'Calculate' button to get the calculated weight on the selected planet.

## Features
